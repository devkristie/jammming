# Codecademy Jammming Project

This is my **Codecademy Jammming Project** built to communicate with Spotify to allow users to add tracks to their very own playlist on the Spotify web site! The application allows the user to search for songs and add them to their track list, then be able to name and save the playlist.

## Key Highlights:

- **Log In Functionality**: Users must log in to Spotify to interact with the app, search for songs, and save their personalized playlists.

- **Interactive Features**: React is used to make the search bar, song list, track list, renaming the playlist, and save to Spotify button function.

## Technologies Used:

- Git
- Github
- React Vite
- JavaScript
- CSS Modules
- Spotify Web API

## Usage:

Once the app is running, you can:

1. Log in with your Spotify account (via OAuth).

2. Search for tracks and add them to your playlist.

3. Rename the playlist and save it to your Spotify account.

## Future Updates:

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: The app will be made fully responsive for mobile and tablet views.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Handling edge cases such as failed API requests more gracefully.
